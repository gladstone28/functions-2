#### Functions

**Putting It All Together**

 of words that represent the ingredients in the sandwich. For example, the first ingredient is 'bread'.

Below the function definition, the function is called. When called, the function outputs a string representing a custom sandwich. We say that the function returns a string. The value of that string is stored in the variable result.

We’ve set up the workspace so that the value of result is translated to ingredients drawn in the app to the far right. With the below code…

```js
result = makeSandwich('burger patty', 'pickles')
